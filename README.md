# Problem Description: 
For our first MIST 4610 group project, we are tasked with constructing a data model and building a corresponding database, populating it with data, and formulating 10 SQL queries that are relevant from a managerial perspective. We have chosen to work with ChatGPT, a simulated client, to develop our project scenario. ChatGPT has been asked to act as the owner/operator of a tennis club in need of a relational database. Through interactions with ChatGPT, we aim to extract information about the tennis club's operations and business processes, enabling us to create a robust data model. The model should consist of at least 12-15 entities, with appropriate attributes and relationships between them. To ensure comprehensive documentation and collaboration, every team member is required to construct and maintain a GitHub repository containing details of the group project's progress. The resulting database and SQL queries should serve the managerial needs of the tennis club, enhancing its operations and decision-making processes. This initiative aims to tackle the complex administrative challenges faced by the club and enable more efficient organization, planning, and communication across all facets of its operation.
